    "# Lab 5: Reactive User Interfaces\n",
    "*Due 5 PM, Tuesday March 26, 2019*\n",
    "\n",
    "This week and next we switch gears and begin a brief study of building user interfaces with [React](https://reactjs.org), a popular UI framework and [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org), a reactive library for managing the *state* of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll expore two main ideas today:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the separation of data and it's flow from how it is processed, whether in a UI presentation layer or in other data processing applications;\n",
    "1. that data (application data or UI events) drives computation. You'll see data-driven or reactive computing in other guises in data science. Today's class considers the UI in this context. That is, the UI viewed as a reactive data-driven function of state.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts will be covered in class. In this lab and subsequent problem set we make these ideas concrete by studying and modifying a minimal application and then applying what we've learned to the web services application we built early in the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 1: Understand How the App is Loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, click on the button below to open the Todo app in a new browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Edit App on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-qvrhjh?embed=1&file=index.js)\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by playing around with the app. Create some todos and try to understand what the app does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to understand how the app works. Start to explore the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, look at `index.html`. It's almost trivially simple. But note two important details, the `<div id=\"app\"></div>` tag in the `body` element and the `<script>` just below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `script` tag loads the JavaScript code in `src/index.js`. Now open the `index.js` file. It contains all the code for the app. Study the last line of the file. It essentially *renders* the app into the DOM `div` element with `id=app`, the one you noted in the `index.html` file. So essentially, we're dynamically loading our app into an empty web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 1: Understand Reactive State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite it's name, React isn't fully *reactive*. That is, it doesn't provide direct facilities for completely separating data and updates to this data from how this data drives computation within a UI. We're using the Mobx state management library to make React reactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to put the logic and data of an app in a separate *store* and have the UI *react* to changes in the store. This separation allows for business logic to be developed on it's own while dramatically simplifying the UI because it deals solely with presentation. (For example, the current version stores it's todo list in a local array; you could easily replace this implementation with one that fetches data from a server. The UI would not be impacted by this change. In fact, we'll do just this next week.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to mobx. The first is to mark instance variables in a store as *observable*. This tells mobx to monitor the variable for changes and whenever a change is made, *react* by automatically running code that *depends* on that variable. In React, this means re-rendering whichever parts of the UI that depend on the *observable* variable. And you inform mobx of this dependency by marking a React component as an `@observer`. Once marked as an observer, mobx notes all of the observable variables that have been accessed when `render` is called for the first time and then triggers re-renders whenever data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of this point, study the code to understand how the todo store and the UI are kept in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 2: Understand the Observer Decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a few tasks an complete some of them by clicking on their names. Now select the filters \"All\", \"Completed\", and \"Active\". Note how the lists are correctly updated in real-time even as new tasks are created. Understand how mobx's reactive state management model operates to keep the lists in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remove the `observer` decorator from the `TodoFilter` component. Reload the app. Does it behave differently? How? And more importantly, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 3: Modify the Todo Listing to use an HTML Table\n",
    "\n",
    "*10 Points*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Todo list is currently rendered in an [HTML unordered list](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ul.asp). Modify the app to replace the \n",
    "list with an HTML table. (Note that editing any of the files will automatically fork a copy of the project.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The table shall have two columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Status**: to show whether the task has been completed or not. Each row for this column shall have a checkbox to indicate. Clicking on the checkbox will toggle the `completed` state of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Name**: The name of the task. Currently, completed tasks are shown as ~~strikken through~~.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show the titles (Status and Name)of each row within an HTML `thead` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 4: Completion and Total Task Count\n",
    "\n",
    "*10 Points*\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a completion count below the table. The completion count will show the number of completed tasks along with the total number of tasks. The screen will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 6 of 10 Completed\n",
    "\n",
    "The counter should be implemented as a stateless React component called `TodoCounter`. Naturally, both numbers should update as tasks are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete this lab in steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add two *computed* getters to `TodoStore`.\n",
    "\n",
    " Call the first `totalTodoCount`. This will simply return the `length` of the `this.todos` array.\n",
    " \n",
    " Call the second getter `completedTodoCount`. This method will compute the number of elements in `this.todos` that have been marked as completed. You can use the `filter` method on the array to derive a sub-array with only completed todos and the calculate it's length with `.length`. You can model your code on the `filtered` method in `TodoStore`.\n",
    "\n",
    " It's important to understand what the *computed* decorator does. It tells mobx to re-render components that depend on the computed function, whenever *observable* variables used by the computed function. Let's say a new (uncompleted) todo is added to the `TodoStore`. This will trigger a re-render of components that use the computed value (because the computed value indirectly depends on an observable).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With the two computed values in hand, create a functional react component called `TotalCompletedCount`. This will take a `todoStore` as a prop. Render a string that says `x tasks of y completed` into the body of a `div`. You can use JavaScript [Template Strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) to format the text. Now insert the `TotalCompletedCount` component at the bottom of `TodoApp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Problem 5: Clear Completed Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "*10 Points*\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a button below the Task completion count to remove all completed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again proceed in steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First create an *action* in the `TodoStore`. Call the action method `removeCompletedTodos`. This method simply scans the `todos` array and removes elements that are marked as complete. A simple way to accomplish this is to first `filter` all uncompleted todos into a local variable and then use the mobx array `replace` method (i.e., `this.todos.replace(uncompletedTodos)`) to exchange the existing todos with uncompleted todos. Because the method is marked as an *action*, it's invocation will trigger a re-render of all components that depend on the observable array `todos`. See [here](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/array.html) for details on the mobx array methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now all you need is a `<button>` that will call the above action when it is clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    " Create a functional component called `RemoveCompletedTodos`. This function will take a `todoStore` as it's prop. A `<button>` element in a `<div>` along with some text such as \"Delete Completed:\". Use the `onclick` attribute to bind the click event to handler. You want to use a lambda whose body simply calls `props.todoStore.removeCompletedTodos()`. See the `onFormSubmit` of `<TodoForm>` for inspiration on how you might do the binding. Remember, in JSX all Javascript code passed to attributes or inserted as children must be escaped with open/close curly braces.\n",
